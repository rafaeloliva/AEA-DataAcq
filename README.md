# Data Acquisition at AEA-UNPA

This repository shows technical aspects related to data acquisition for evaluation of renewable energy sources systems developed at Area Energías Alternativas - ITA / UNPA [AEA-UNPA](https://www.uarg.unpa.edu.ar/ita/index.php/investigacion-2/grupos-investigacion?showall=&start=1) based on continuos cooperation with [CERE/UMAG](http://umag.cl/cere/) of the University of Magallanes, and with OES at UTN-FRRo [OES-UTN](http://www.oesutnrosario.org/). The project developed here (**SISMED-RG24**) started development in 2018, and measurements based on a [CampbellScientific](https://www.campbellsci.com/)  CR1000 system have been upgraded from very simple version (end of 2019), with integrated HTTP Server, to a more complex system (2021) with CR1000, Raspberry Pi4B, Mikrotik Router, an external RS485 ArduinoMega module for Temperature/Humidity and + MQTT/TLS connection to a remote Thingsboard CE Server supported by OES/UTN. Focus is made on programming, and the electronic support system developed. Source code, flow charts and schematics are included, as well as images of the system. Use of a  LoggerNet v4.1 was acquired in 2013 at CERE UMAG with project funding, and academic licenses of Windographer 4.2.21 were acquired by UNPA. Results are presented in papers published in recent meetings, sadly only in spanish but with abstracts and source code comments in english.  
<br/> 

These projects are possible thru the hard work, cooperation and support of the AEA-UNPA team (https://en.energiasalternativas-unpa.net/), of Marcelo Castello at OES/UTN (https://github.com/mcastellogh), and Dr. Humberto Vidal, Ing. María Rosa Gallardo and Pedro Gallardo of CERE/UMAG.
